# ZoomInfo

The ZoomInfo Node SDK allows developers to interact with the
[ZoomInfo API](https://api-docs.zoominfo.com/#intro). You can use this library to query the ZoomInfo
database for relevant companies and contacts and enrich the data records in your Customer
Relationship Management (CRM), Marketing Automation (MA), and other systems in your organization.

## Installation

The easiest way to install zoominfo is using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zoominfo-node). Run the command below from
your project directory to install the library.

```bash
npm install zoominfo-node
```

Then in your code:

TypeScript:

```javascript
import zoominfo from 'zoominfo-node';
```

JavaScript:

```javascript
const zoominfo = require('zoominfo-node').default;
```

### Authentication Methods

This library supports the following Authentication methods.

- Private Key Infrastructure (PKI)
- Username and Password

For both authentication methods a Java Web Token (JWT), that is valid for one hour is returned which
is used to access the API

### Username and Password

```javascript
const zoom = await zoominfo.client({username: '<username>', password: 'password'});
```

### Private Key Infrastructure (PKI)

```javascript
const zoom = await zoominfo.client({
  username: '<username>',
  clientId: '<clientId>',
  privateKey: '<privateKey>',
});
```

### Refreshing Access Token

```javascript
await zoom.refreshAccessToken();
```

## Sample Usage

### Contact Search

Use Contact Search to retrieve contacts using valid query parameters.

```javascript
await zoom.search.contactSearch
  .getContactSearch({companyName: 'ZoomInfo'})
  .then((res: IContactSearchResults) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err: ZoomInfoException) => console.log(err));
```

### Intent Enrich

Use this endpoint to enrich intent data for a company based on input values and return the desired
output fields in the response.

```javascript
await zoom.enrich.intentEnrich
  .getIntentEnrich({companyId: '344589814'})
  .then((res: IIntentEnrichResults) => console.log(res))
  .catch((err: ZoomInfoException) => console.log(err));
```

## API Structure

The ZoomInfo API is a set of HTTPS endpoints you can use to programmatically retrieve and integrate
ZoomInfo data into your existing technology stack and workflows. Responses are returned in JSON to
support integration with common programming languages and development kits.

- Enterprise API
  - The [Enterprise API](https://api-docs.zoominfo.com/#614aa0e9-f630-4c0b-8e2a-b2cf60753dcd)
    supports searching for and enriching company and contact records.
    - The [Search API](https://api-docs.zoominfo.com/#156045a9-6446-4c61-b9fb-706476cfac6a) accepts
      various input criteria which are used to return Contacts, Companies, Scoops, News and Intent
      records.
    - The [Enrich API](https://api-docs.zoominfo.com/#6c2de74a-e026-401b-8910-503ae7aa57c8) is used
      to retrieve ZoomInfo's full profile data by matching to known contacts or companies.
    - The [Lookup API](https://api-docs.zoominfo.com/#28358f09-9863-42af-a93c-6710a8cacf9d) includes
      a set of endpoints that return available inputs and outputs for corresponding Search or Enrich
      requests.
- WebSights API
  - The [WebSights API](https://api-docs.zoominfo.com/#594fcf78-2a83-46c1-ae54-bde1be1af02d)
    identifies anonymous website traffic by resolving IP addresses to return company and ISP
    profiles and IP Geolocation details.
- Compliance API
  - The [Compliance API](https://api-docs.zoominfo.com/#6b305a99-cbad-4a44-aaa4-23b14d126a43)
    includes endpoints related to data privacy and opt-out compliance for contacts stored in the
    ZoomInfo database.

## Rate and Usage Limiting

The ZoomInfo API uses rate and usage limiting tied to the account provisioned for API access. Your
API account is provisioned with:

- Rate limits: A limit to the number of requests you can make within a given time period.
  - For the Authentication endpoint, the limit is 1 request per second.
  - For other endpoints, the limit is 1500 requests per minute.
- Request limits: An overall number of requests you can perform within the current API contract
  term.
- Record limits: The number of records you are entitled to retrieve within the current API contract
  term.

You can track usage status using the Usage Lookup endpoint.

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

The API will return standard classes of HTTP error status codes (4xx client and 5xx server codes) as
well as 2xx success codes.
